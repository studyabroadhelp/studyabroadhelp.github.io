  <h2 class="intro-title">Honest Guidance for Indian Students</h2>
  <div class="intro-divider"></div>

  <p>◉ Every year, thousands of Indian students aspire to become doctors, but
     limited government seats and high fees in private medical colleges make
     this dream difficult for many families.</p>

  <p>◉ As a result, studying MBBS abroad has emerged as a practical option,
     provided students carefully choose the right country and clearly
     understand the admission process.</p>

  <p>◉ Kyrgyzstan offers an affordable, structured, and internationally
     recognized pathway for Indian students to pursue medical education
     without the heavy financial burden associated with private colleges
     in India.</p>

  <p>◉ This page aims to provide factual and transparent information on why
     Kyrgyzstan is chosen by many Indian students, covering key aspects such
     as education quality, safety, recognition, and long-term career scope.</p>

  <p>◉ Our focus is not on unrealistic promises, but on helping students and
     parents make informed decisions based on honesty, clarity, and real-world
     understanding.</p>
