  <h2>Recognition & Validity (WHO, NMC, FMGE)</h2>

  <p>
    Studying MBBS in Kyrgyzstan is legally recognized and accepted globally.
    However, students must clearly understand medical council rules before
    taking admission. This section explains the facts honestly.
  </p>

  <h3>World Health Organization (WHO)</h3>
  <p>
    Medical universities in Kyrgyzstan are listed in the World Directory of
    Medical Schools (WDOMS). This listing is required for international
    recognition and eligibility to appear in licensing exams.
  </p>

  <h3>National Medical Commission (NMC) – India</h3>
  <p>
    Indian students graduating from Kyrgyzstan must follow NMC guidelines.
    According to current rules, students must complete the required duration
    of course, internship, and clear the screening exam to practice in India.
  </p>

  <h3>FMGE / NExT Examination</h3>
  <p>
    After returning to India, students must qualify the FMGE (Foreign Medical
    Graduate Examination) or NExT (as applicable) to obtain registration.
    Passing these exams is mandatory to practice medicine in India.
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    Important:</strong> No foreign medical degree gives automatic license in
    India. Students should choose this path only with full awareness and
    proper preparation.
